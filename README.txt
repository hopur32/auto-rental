Thank you for choosing HÃ³pur-32's automobile rental program.

Before we can get into using the program, there are a few things we have to attend to to make sure that the program will run correctly

1. You'll need to install Python on your computer. Some computers come with Python pre-installed, but otherwise you can download Python from their homepage: https://www.python.org/
2. Despite having installed Python on your computer, there are still sub-parts of python (modules) that we need to install. You can do so by opening a terminal in the root of this project and executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`

And that's it.
You've successfully installed and set up the Auto-Rental system and are good for business.
To launch the program simply run the 'Main.py' file.

(The example files can be moved into AppData\Local\hopur-32\Auto-Rental and renamed into [Orders.txt, Customers.txt, Vehicles.txt] for testing purposes if you're on Windows)
